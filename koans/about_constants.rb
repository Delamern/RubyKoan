  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?
  # Oyster wasn't defined inside of MyAnimals, so it goes digging through inheritance hierarchy.
  # Inheritance has 4 as the value, so it displays 4.
  # So it checks enclosing scope, then any outer scopes (up to but not including the top level)
  # Included modules, superclasses, top level, object, kernal.
  # So Oyster would check it's class def. No number, so move up to Animal. LEGS is defined in Animal so it uses that value.
  # If LEGS wasn't defined in Animal, there would be an error as MyAnimal only has Legs within it's lexical scope, which Oyster
  # was made outside of.

  #Long story short, don't do this.
